MicroDonuts: An OpenTelemetry Walkthrough
=========================================


Welcome to MicroDonuts! This is a sample application and OpenTelemetry
walkthrough, written in Python.

OpenTelemetry is a vendor-neutral, open standard for distributed tracing. To
learn more, check out http://opentelemetry.io, and try the walkthrough below!

There are two versions of the example app, ``walkthrough/server.py`` does not
contain tracing while ``walkthrough/server_instrumented.py`` does.

This guide has two exclusive steps:

- `Step 1, Alternative A: Add Tracing`_ shows how to manually add tracing information to an
  application.
- `Step 1, Alternative B: Use oteltrace-run`_ shows how to use oteltrace-run to autoinstrument
  an application without adding tracing manually.

Step 0: Setup MicroDonuts
=========================

Getting it
----------

#. Install ``virtualenv``: ``sudo -H pip3 install virtualenv``
#. Create a virtual environment: ``mkdir microdonuts; virtualenv microdonuts``
#. Activate the virtual environment: ``source microdonuts/bin/activate``
#. Clone this repository
#. Install the dependencies ``pip3 install -r python-opentelemetry-walkthrough/requirements.txt``

Running
-------

#. ``python python-opentelemetry-walkthrough/walkthrough/server.py``
#. Open your web browser, navigate to ``http://127.0.0.1:8082`` and order yourself some Âµ-donuts.

MicroDonuts has 4 server endpoints:

#. ``/order``
#. ``/status``
#. ``/kitchen/add_donuts``
#. ``/kitchen/get_donuts``

The first 2 serve orders, the last 2 provide kitchen services.

Step 1, Alternative A: Add Tracing
==================================

When you go to add tracing to a system, the best place to start is by
installing OpenTelemetry plugins for the OSS components you are using.
Instrumenting your networking libraries, web frameworks, and service clients
quickly gives you a lot of information about your distributed system, without
requiring you to change a lot of code.

To do this, let's change the startup of the application to include tracing:
``cd python-opentelemetry-walkthrough/walkthrough``

Start the global tracer
-----------------------

In OpenTelemetry, there is a concept of a global tracer for everyone to access.

Accessing this global tracer is easy, just add these lines to ``server.py``
under ``BLOCK 0``:

.. code:: python

    from opentelemetry import trace
    from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider

Add these lines under ``BLOCK 2`` too:

.. code:: python

    tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

The global tracer is now available as ``tracer``.


Instrument the HTTP requests
----------------------------

This is done in an automatic way by just adding this line under ``BLOCK 0``:

.. code:: python

    from opentelemetry.http_requests import enable

Add also this line under ``BLOCK 2``:

.. code:: python

    enable(tracer)

Instrument Flask
----------------

This example uses Flask to expose the HTTP endpoints. Flask code can
be traced automatically by adding this line under ``BLOCK 0``:

.. code:: python

    from opentelemetry.ext.flask import FlaskInstrumentor

Add this line under ``BLOCK 1`` also:

.. code:: python

    FlaskInstrumentor().instrument()

Add an exporter
---------------

An exporter is necessary for the span data to be displayed. We'll use the
``ConsoleExporter`` in this example, an exporter that simply prints the span data
into the console. Add these lines under ``BLOCK 0``:

.. code:: python

    from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import ConsoleSpanExporter
    from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import SimpleExportSpanProcessor

Add these lines under ``BLOCK 2``:

.. code:: python

    trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider())
    trace.get_tracer_provider().add_span_processor(
        SimpleExportSpanProcessor(ConsoleSpanExporter())
    )

Use the tracer
--------------

Now is time to use the tracer itself in the server code.

Change the ``order`` function to this:

.. code:: python

    @app.route('/order', methods=['POST'])
    def order():

        order_id = str(uuid4())

        with tracer.start_span('root_span'):

            for donut_data in loads(next(request.form.keys()))['donuts']:

                for _ in range(donut_data['quantity']):

                    kitchen_consumer.add_donut(donut_data, order_id)

            return kitchen_consumer.check_status(order_id)

Change the ``status`` function to this:

.. code:: python

    @app.route('/status', methods=['POST'])
    def status():

        with tracer.start_span('status_span'):

            return kitchen_consumer.check_status(
                loads(next(request.form.keys()))['order_id']
            )

This will automatically create a span every time each of these functions are
called.

Step 1, Alternative B: Use oteltrace-run
========================================

``otel-trace`` allows to automatically instrument applications written in python.

Installation
------------

oteltrace-py doesn't have a PyPI packet yet, it has to be installed from source:

::

    # install oteltrace-py (will install opentelemetry as well)
    git clone https://github.com/lightstep/otel-trace-py -b mauricio/clean_code
    cd otel-trace-py
    pip install -e .

Running
-------

Before running the application, the console exporter has to be configured as the
exporter.

::

    # module where the opentelemetry SDK exporter is implemented
    export OTEL_EXPORTER_MODULE=opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export
    # factory function that returns an instance of the exporter
    # (constructor in this case)
    export OTEL_EXPORTER_FACTORY=ConsoleSpanExporter

Now you can run the microdonuts application:

::

    oteltrace-run python python-opentelemetry-walkthrough/walkthrough/server.py

Step 2: Have Fun
================

You can run the walkthrough again as explained before. You should see the span
data displayed in the console.

Thanks for playing, and welcome to OpenTelemetry!
